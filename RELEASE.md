# Release Process

The process of creating a release is described in this document. Replace `X.Y.Z` with the version to be released.

## 3. Create a new tag 

Use `vX.Y.Z` tag when creating the tag.
X.Y.Z is expected to be valid [semver](https://semver.org/): it should be digits, and we can use labels such as X.Y.Z-alpha.

Ensure that the release notes explicitly mention upgrade instructions and any breaking change.
